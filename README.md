- Hi, Iâ€™m Hanh Dinh. I am currently a cloud application development student at Microsoft Software and Systems Academy. 
- Background Info: I have spent the last three and half years in the U.S. Marine Corps as an ammunition technician. I was able to live in Japan for two years and travel to the    Phillipines! I'm now residing in sunny Southern California.
- I am interested in pursuing a career in tech after my transition out of the military. I am fascinated by how we can use technology to help humandkind solve everyday problems. Follow along my journey on learning how to code without any prior IT experience.
- Hobbies: watching the sunset at the beach, practicing brush calligraphy, and trying out new boba shops!
